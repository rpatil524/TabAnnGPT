{"Book/description": "**Tips to distinguish 'description of book' label:**\n\n1. **'description of book' vs. 'name of book':** \n   - The 'description of book' provides a summary or overview of the book's content, themes, or purpose, often using complete sentences. In contrast, the 'name of book' is typically a short title or phrase that identifies the book without elaboration. For example, \"A thrilling adventure of a young wizard\" is a description, while \"Harry Potter\" is a name.\n\n2. **'description of book' vs. 'review':**\n   - A 'description of book' focuses on explaining what the book is about, while a 'review' includes personal opinions, critiques, or evaluations of the book. For instance, \"This book explores the complexities of human relationships\" is a description, whereas \"This book is a captivating read that kept me engaged\" is a review.\n\n3. **'description of book' vs. 'book format':**\n   - The 'description of book' discusses the content and themes, while 'book format' refers to the physical or digital characteristics of the book, such as \"Paperback,\" \"Ebook,\" or \"Hardcover.\" For example, \"This book provides insights into modern economics\" is a description, while \"Paperback edition\" indicates the book format.\n\n4. **'description of book' vs. 'language':**\n   - The 'description of book' elaborates on the book's content, while 'language' specifies the language in which the book is written, such as \"English,\" \"Spanish,\" or \"French.\" For example, \"This book delves into the history of art\" is a description, while \"English\" simply states the language.", "DeliveryMethod": "**Tips to distinguish 'delivery method' from 'item availability':**  \n- Look for terms that indicate how a product is delivered, such as \"DeliveryModeMail,\" \"DeliveryModeDirectDownload,\" or \"DeliveryModeFreight.\" These terms specifically refer to the logistics of getting the item to the customer.  \n- In contrast, 'item availability' typically includes phrases like \"InStock,\" \"Out of Stock,\" or \"Preorder,\" which indicate the status of the product rather than the method of delivery.\n\n**Tips to distinguish 'delivery method' from 'unit code':**  \n- Identify if the column contains codes or identifiers that are used for inventory management or product classification. Unit codes often consist of alphanumeric strings that do not describe delivery logistics.  \n- Delivery method labels will reference specific modes of transport or delivery services, while unit codes will not provide any information about how the product is shipped or received.\n\n**Tips to distinguish 'delivery method' from 'time':**  \n- Check if the column values represent durations or timeframes, such as \"PT1H30M\" or \"PT45M,\" which indicate how long a process takes. This is characteristic of time-related labels.  \n- Delivery method labels will focus on the type of delivery (e.g., \"DeliveryModeOwnFleet\") rather than any temporal aspect, so if the values are time-based, they do not pertain to delivery methods.", "price": "**Tips to distinguish 'price' label:**\n\n1. **'item availability':** Look for values that indicate stock status, such as \"InStock\" or \"OutOfStock.\" These terms are not monetary values and signify the availability of an item rather than its cost.\n\n2. **'currency':** Check for abbreviations or symbols that represent currency, such as \"USD,\" \"EUR,\" or \"$.\" These are not prices themselves but indicate the type of currency used for the price.\n\n3. **'number':** Identify values that represent quantities or counts, such as \"10,\" \"5.5,\" or \"100.\" These values typically do not have a monetary context and are used for measurements or quantities rather than pricing.\n\n4. **'unit code':** Look for alphanumeric codes that represent specific product identifiers or classifications, such as \"SKU12345\" or \"ABC-001.\" These codes do not reflect a monetary value and are used for inventory or cataloging purposes.", "Number": "**Tips to distinguish the 'number' label:**\n\n1. **'Number' vs. 'Distance':** \n   - Look for context: If the values represent a measurement of length (e.g., kilometers, miles), they are likely labeled as 'distance.' For example, \"5 kilometers\" indicates a distance, while \"5\" alone could be a count or quantity.\n\n2. **'Number' vs. 'Energy':**\n   - Check the unit of measurement: If the values are associated with energy units like calories, joules, or kilojoules, they should be labeled as 'energy.' For instance, \"300 calories\" clearly indicates energy content, whereas \"300\" alone does not specify energy.\n\n3. **'Number' vs. 'Price':**\n   - Identify currency indicators: If the values include currency symbols (e.g., $, \u20ac, \u00a3) or are formatted as monetary amounts (e.g., \"$10.00\"), they should be labeled as 'price.' A simple number without a currency context is more likely to be labeled as 'number.'\n\n4. **'Number' vs. 'Quantitative Value':**\n   - Assess the context of the value: If the values represent a count, measurement, or quantity that is not strictly numerical (e.g., \"serves 4,\" \"2 cups\"), they should be labeled as 'quantitative value.' In contrast, a standalone number like \"4\" without context is more likely to be labeled as 'number.'", "Person/name": "### Tips to Distinguish 'name of person' from Other Labels\n\n1. **'name of book'**: Look for titles that are typically longer and may include subtitles. Book titles often have a formal structure and may include phrases like \"by\" or \"author\" in the context.\n\n2. **'number'**: Numbers are usually presented as digits or in a numerical format. If the value is purely numeric without any accompanying text, it is likely a number rather than a person's name.\n\n3. **'duration'**: Duration values often follow a specific format, such as \"PT10M\" or \"1 hour\". They indicate time and are not structured like names, which typically consist of first and last names.\n\n4. **'brand'**: Brand names are often short and may be associated with products. They usually do not follow the structure of a person's name and can be recognized by their association with specific items or services.\n\n5. **'rating'**: Ratings are typically numerical values or scores, often accompanied by a scale (e.g., 4.5 out of 5). They do not resemble names and are used to evaluate quality rather than identify individuals.\n\n6. **'language'**: Language labels are usually single words or short phrases (e.g., \"English\", \"Spanish\"). They do not follow the structure of a person's name and are not composed of multiple parts.\n\n7. **'itemlist'**: Item lists often contain multiple entries or ingredients, typically separated by commas or semicolons. They do not resemble names and are more descriptive of contents rather than individuals.\n\n8. **'mass'**: Mass values are usually expressed in units (e.g., grams, kilograms) and are numeric. They do not follow the naming convention of individuals and are focused on measurement.\n\n9. **'restricted diet'**: Restricted diet labels often include terms related to dietary preferences or restrictions (e.g., \"vegan\", \"gluten-free\"). They are descriptive and do not resemble personal names.\n\n10. **'date'**: Dates are formatted in specific ways (e.g., \"YYYY-MM-DD\" or \"MM/DD/YYYY\") and are numeric. They do not follow the structure of a person's name and indicate a point in time rather than an individual.", "Date": "**Tips to distinguish the 'date' label:**\n\n1. **Format**: Dates typically follow a specific format, such as YYYY-MM-DD or MM/DD/YYYY. Look for consistent patterns that resemble calendar dates.\n2. **Context**: Dates often relate to events, releases, or occurrences. If the value indicates a time-related context, it is likely a date.\n3. **Numerical Range**: Dates usually fall within a reasonable range (e.g., years from 1900 to the current year). Values outside this range may indicate a different label.\n\n**Tips to distinguish 'date' from 'number':**\n\n1. **Value Type**: Numbers are often whole or decimal values without any time-related context. If the value is purely numerical and does not indicate a time or date, it is likely a number.\n2. **Contextual Relevance**: If the value represents a quantity, count, or measurement (e.g., page numbers, ratings), it is more likely a number rather than a date.\n\n**Tips to distinguish 'date' from 'price':**\n\n1. **Currency Symbols**: Prices usually include currency symbols (e.g., $, \u20ac, \u00a3) or are formatted with decimal points to indicate cents. If the value has a currency symbol, it is a price, not a date.\n2. **Contextual Clues**: Prices are often associated with products or services and may appear alongside terms like \"cost,\" \"price,\" or \"value.\" If the context suggests a financial aspect, it is likely a price.\n\n**Tips to distinguish 'date' from 'rating':**\n\n1. **Value Range**: Ratings typically fall within a specific range (e.g., 1 to 5 stars or 1 to 10). If the value is constrained within a limited scale, it is likely a rating rather than a date.\n2. **Descriptive Context**: Ratings are often accompanied by terms like \"rating,\" \"score,\" or \"review.\" If the context suggests evaluation or assessment, it is likely a rating, not a date.", "priceRange": "**Tips to distinguish 'price range' from 'price':**\n\n1. **Format**: Price range values typically include a range or a comparison, such as \"from $10 to $50\" or \"$30 and under.\" In contrast, price values are usually singular amounts, like \"$14.99\" or \"$6.99.\"\n\n2. **Context**: Price range is often used in contexts where multiple pricing options are available, indicating a spectrum of prices for different items or services. Price, however, is used when referring to a specific cost of a single item or service.\n\n3. **Presence of Multiple Values**: If a column contains multiple price points separated by semicolons or commas (e.g., \"$6.99; $17.99\"), it is likely indicating different prices rather than a range.\n\n4. **Descriptive Language**: Price range may include terms like \"under,\" \"to,\" or \"between,\" while price is straightforward and does not include such qualifiers.\n\n**Example**: \"Cost: $25 - $50\" indicates a price range, while \"$16.99\" is a specific price.", "Rating": "**Tips to distinguish 'rating' label:**\n\n1. **Rating vs. Price**: Ratings typically range from a low to a high value, often on a scale (e.g., 1 to 10, or 0 to 5 stars). Prices, on the other hand, are usually formatted with a currency symbol (e.g., $24.99) and may include decimal points. Look for the presence of currency symbols to identify price.\n\n2. **Rating vs. Number**: Ratings are often associated with subjective evaluations of quality, while numbers can represent quantities, counts, or identifiers. If the value appears to be a count (e.g., number of pages, items, or votes), it is likely a number rather than a rating.\n\n3. **Rating vs. Duration**: Ratings are generally not expressed in time formats. Duration values often include units of time (e.g., minutes, hours) or are formatted as \"PT\" followed by a time duration (e.g., PT1H30M). If the value indicates a time measurement, it is likely duration.\n\n4. **Rating vs. Energy**: Energy values are typically expressed in terms of calories or other energy units (e.g., kcal). If the value is associated with nutritional information or energy content, it is likely an energy measurement rather than a rating.\n\n5. **Rating vs. Time**: Time values are often formatted in a way that indicates a specific duration or timestamp (e.g., \"2 hours\", \"2020-01-01\"). If the value indicates a specific time or duration, it is likely a time measurement rather than a rating.\n\n6. **Rating vs. Unit Code**: Unit codes are often alphanumeric strings that represent specific product identifiers or classifications.

Look for terms like \"Visa,\" \"MasterCard,\" or \"Cash.\"  \n- In contrast, the 'unit code' label usually consists of a specific alphanumeric code that identifies a product or item, often without any reference to payment methods. For example, a unit code might look like \"BSC-01-UNS-L\" and does not mention any payment options.\n\n**Tips to distinguish 'payment accepted' from 'delivery method':**  \n- The 'payment accepted' label focuses on the types of payments a business will accept, such as \"Credit card,\" \"Cash,\" or \"PayPal.\"  \n- The 'delivery method' label, however, describes how a product will be delivered, using terms like \"Standard Shipping,\" \"Express Delivery,\" or specific courier names like \"DHL\" or \"FedEx.\" Look for phrases that indicate shipping or delivery services rather than payment options.", "category": "**Tips to distinguish the 'category' label:**\n- Look for values that describe the occasion, theme, or type of product. Categories often include specific events (e.g., Mother's Day, Valentine's Day) or general descriptors (e.g., Birthday, Sympathy).\n- Categories typically consist of multiple related terms or phrases that indicate the intended use or sentiment behind the product.\n\n**Tips to distinguish the 'delivery method' label:**\n- Identify values that specify how the product will be delivered or the logistics involved. This may include terms like \"DeliveryModeOwnFleet\" or other phrases indicating shipping methods.\n- Delivery methods are usually more technical and focused on the process of getting the product to the customer, rather than the emotional or thematic context of the product itself.", "Review": "**Tips to distinguish 'review' from 'description of recipe':**  \n- Reviews typically express personal opinions or experiences regarding a product or service, often using subjective language (e.g., \"I love this product\" or \"It helped me a lot\").  \n- Descriptions of recipes focus on the ingredients, preparation methods, and cooking times without personal opinions. Look for phrases that detail the recipe steps or list ingredients rather than personal experiences.  \n\n**Tips to distinguish 'review' from 'country':**  \n- Reviews contain subjective evaluations or feedback about a product or service, often including personal anecdotes or ratings.  \n- Country labels provide factual information about a location, often including geographical or cultural references without any personal opinion or evaluation. Look for straightforward, objective statements that identify a place rather than subjective commentary.", "DateTime": "**Tips to distinguish 'date and time' label:**\n- Look for a format that includes both date and time components, typically in the format \"YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS+00:00\" or similar variations. \n- Ensure that the entry includes both a date and a time, as well as a timezone offset (e.g., \"+00:00\").\n\n**Tips to distinguish 'date' label:**\n- Check for entries that only contain a date without a time component. For example, a value like \"2020-01-27\" is a date, while \"2020-01-27T00:00:00\" would indicate a date and time.\n- If the entry lacks time information and is formatted as \"YYYY-MM-DD\" or similar, it should be classified as a date.\n\n**Tips to distinguish 'date and time' label from 'energy' label:**\n- Energy values are typically numerical and represent a measurement of calories or similar units (e.g., \"160 kcal\"). They do not follow the date and time format.\n- If the entry is a number followed by a unit of measurement (like kcal, J, or kJ), it should be classified as energy rather than date and time.\n\n**Tips to distinguish 'date and time' label from 'language' label:**\n- Language entries usually consist of text that represents a language name (e.g., \"English\", \"Spanish\") and do not follow the date and time format.\n- If the entry is a single word or phrase that identifies a language, it should be classified as language, not date and time.", "unitText": "**Tips to distinguish 'unit text' from 'distance':**  \n- 'Unit text' typically describes a measurement or quantity in a general sense (e.g., \"Kg\", \"EUR\"). In contrast, 'distance' specifically refers to physical measurements of length (e.g., \"9.23 cm\", \"0.00 inches\").  \n- Look for numeric values followed by specific units of measurement (e.g., cm, inches) to identify 'distance'.\n\n**Tips to distinguish 'unit text' from 'restricted diet':**  \n- 'Unit text' provides information about the type of unit or currency, while 'restricted diet' refers to dietary restrictions or classifications (e.g., \"GlutenFreeDiet\").  \n- If the text indicates a dietary preference or restriction, it should be labeled as 'restricted diet'.\n\n**Tips to distinguish 'unit text' from 'mass':**  \n- 'Unit text' is often used for general units or currencies, while 'mass' specifically refers to weight measurements (e.g., \"310 g\", \"60 g\").  \n- Check if the value is explicitly indicating weight; if so, it should be labeled as 'mass'.\n\n**Tips to distinguish 'unit text' from 'quantitative value':**  \n- 'Unit text' describes a unit of measure or currency, while 'quantitative value' indicates a specific quantity or serving size (e.g., \"4 servings\", \"1 9x13 pan\").  \n- If the value represents a count or serving size, it should be classified as 'quantitative value'.", "Recipe/description": "**Tips to distinguish 'description of recipe' from 'quantitative value':**  \n- The 'description of recipe' typically provides a narrative about the dish, including its flavors, preparation style, or context. In contrast, 'quantitative value' focuses on numerical information, such as serving sizes or quantities, without descriptive context. For example, a recipe description might say, \"This dish is a delightful blend of spices,\" while a quantitative value would simply state, \"Serves 4.\"\n\n**Tips to distinguish 'description of recipe' from 'description of product':**  \n- A 'description of recipe' emphasizes the cooking process, ingredients, and the overall experience of making the dish. In contrast, a 'description of product' focuses on the characteristics of a specific item, such as its ingredients, uses, or packaging. For instance, a recipe description might highlight how to prepare a dish, while a product description would detail the product's features, like \"This sauce is made with organic tomatoes.\"\n\n**Tips to distinguish 'description of recipe' from 'itemlist':**  \n- The 'description of recipe' provides a narrative about the dish, including cooking methods and flavor profiles. An 'itemlist,' however, is a straightforward enumeration of ingredients or components without additional context. For example, a recipe description might say, \"This hearty soup is filled with vegetables,\" while an itemlist would simply list the ingredients like \"carrots, potatoes, onions.\"\n\n**Tips to distinguish 'description of recipe' from 'mass':**  \n- A 'description of recipe' conveys the essence and preparation of a dish, often including sensory details. In contrast, 'mass' refers to the weight of an ingredient or dish, typically presented in grams or kilograms. For example, a recipe description might say, \"This cake is light and fluffy,\" while a mass entry would state, \"Weight: 500 grams.\"\n\n**Tips to distinguish 'description of recipe' from 'restricted diet':**  \n- The 'description of recipe' focuses on the dish's preparation and taste, while 'restricted diet' specifies dietary considerations or restrictions related to the recipe. For instance, a recipe description might say, \"This pasta dish is rich and creamy,\" whereas a restricted diet entry would indicate, \"Suitable for gluten-free diets.\"", "weight": "**Tips to distinguish 'weight' label:**\n\n1. **Weight vs. Mass**: \n   - Weight is typically expressed in units that indicate gravitational force (e.g., pounds, kilograms) and often appears alongside a numerical value that represents the force exerted by gravity on an object. \n   - Mass, on the other hand, is a measure of the amount of matter in an object and can also be expressed in similar units but is often accompanied by terms like \"grams\" or \"kilograms\" without a direct reference to gravity. Look for context clues in the description that indicate whether the value is a force (weight) or a measure of matter (mass).\n\n2. **Weight vs. Unit Text**: \n   - Weight values are usually numerical and directly associated with a specific measurement unit (e.g., \"5 kg\", \"10 lbs\"). \n   - Unit text, however, often describes the type of measurement or category (e.g., \"lbs\", \"kg\") without a numerical value preceding it. If the column contains only text or a combination of text and numbers that describe the type of unit rather than a weight measurement, it is likely unit text.\n\n3. **Weight vs. Unit Code**: \n   - Weight is a quantitative measure and will always have a numerical value associated with a unit of measurement. \n   - Unit code typically refers to a standardized code or identifier for a unit of measure (e.g., \"KGM\" for kilograms) and does not represent a weight value itself. If the column contains a code that does not have a numerical value preceding it, it is likely a unit code.", "Duration": "**Tips to distinguish the 'duration' label:**\n\n1. **Format**: Duration values typically follow a specific format, such as \"PT1H30M\" (indicating 1 hour and 30 minutes) or \"124 Min.\" (indicating 124 minutes). Look for these time-related formats.\n  \n2. **Context**: Duration is often associated with the length of a film, show, or event. If the context is about how long something lasts, it is likely to be labeled as 'duration'.\n\n**Tips to distinguish 'duration' from 'time':**\n\n1. **Specificity**: The 'time' label usually refers to a specific point in time (e.g., a date or timestamp) rather than a length. For example, \"2019-05-23\" indicates a specific date, while 'duration' would indicate how long something lasts.\n\n2. **Usage**: If the value represents a moment or date (like a release date), it should be labeled as 'time'. In contrast, if it indicates how long an activity takes, it should be labeled as 'duration'.\n\n**Tips to distinguish 'duration' from 'quantitative value':**\n\n1. **Nature of Value**: Quantitative values often represent amounts or measurements (e.g., \"10 grams\", \"3 cups\") rather than time. If the value is a measurement of quantity rather than a time duration, it should be labeled as 'quantitative value'.\n\n2. **Contextual Relevance**: If the context involves ingredients, nutritional information, or any form of measurement, it is likely to be 'quantitative value'. Duration, however, is specifically about the length of time something takes.", "RestrictedDiet": "**Tips to distinguish 'restricted diet' from 'time':**\n\n1. **Content Focus**: The 'restricted diet' label typically includes specific dietary restrictions or classifications, such as \"Vegan,\" \"GlutenFreeDiet,\" or \"Dairy-Free.\" In contrast, the 'time' label focuses on the duration of preparation or cooking, often represented in formats like \"PT15M\" or \"PT1H.\"\n\n2. **Keywords**: Look for keywords associated with dietary needs (e.g., \"vegan,\" \"gluten-free\") for 'restricted diet.' For 'time,' the keywords will relate to time measurements (e.g., \"minutes,\" \"hours\").\n\n3. **Contextual Relevance**: If the content discusses ingredients or dietary preferences, it is likely a 'restricted diet.' If it discusses how long a recipe takes to prepare or cook, it is likely a 'time' label.\n\n4. **Examples**: A recipe labeled as 'restricted diet' might mention \"suitable for gluten-free diets,\" while a 'time' label would indicate \"cooking time: 30 minutes.\" \n\nBy focusing on these distinctions, you can accurately categorize the labels.", "Recipe/name": "**Tips to distinguish 'name of recipe' from 'description of recipe':**\n\n1. **Content Type**: The 'name of recipe' typically consists of a concise title that clearly identifies the dish, often including specific ingredients or cooking methods (e.g., \"Vegan Oatmeal Pancakes\"). In contrast, the 'description of recipe' provides a more detailed narrative about the dish, including its characteristics, flavors, or context (e.g., \"Here\u2019s an absolutely delicious gluten-free plant-based dish for dinner tonight!\").\n\n2. **Length and Structure**: The 'name of recipe' is usually short and straightforward, while the 'description of recipe' is longer and may contain multiple sentences or phrases that elaborate on the recipe's appeal or preparation.\n\n3. **Purpose**: The 'name of recipe' serves to label the dish for easy identification, whereas the 'description of recipe' aims to entice or inform the reader about what to expect from the dish, often highlighting its unique features or benefits.\n\n4. **Use of Adjectives**: The 'description of recipe' often includes adjectives and descriptive phrases that convey taste, texture, or health benefits (e.g., \"light and fluffy,\" \"perfectly moist\"), which are absent in the 'name of recipe'. \n\nBy focusing on these distinctions, one can effectively differentiate between the two labels.", "Country": "**Tips to distinguish the 'country' label:**\n- Look for values that represent a nation or region, typically consisting of a name (e.g., \"France,\" \"US,\" \"KH\") or an abbreviation (e.g., \"CA,\" \"VA\").\n- Country values are often associated with geographical locations and can be found in contexts related to international addresses or locations.\n\n**Tips to distinguish the 'price range' label:**\n- Price range values usually consist of symbols or words indicating cost levels, such as \"$,\" \"$$,\" or \"$$$.\"\n- These values often reflect the affordability or pricing structure of a service or product and are typically used in contexts related to dining, shopping, or services rather than geographical locations.", "streetAddress": "**Tips to distinguish 'street address' label:**\n\n1. **Street Address vs. Time**: A street address typically includes specific location details such as building numbers, street names, and sometimes additional identifiers like floor numbers (e.g., \"28/F-29/F, 18 On Lan Street\"). In contrast, time entries will include time formats (e.g., \"09:00 AM - 09:00 PM\") and may reference days of the week or specific meal times (e.g., \"Dinner 4:30 p.m. - 9 p.m.\").\n\n2. **Street Address vs. Postal Address**: A street address focuses on the physical location where a business is situated, often including street names and numbers (e.g., \"1362 Naamans Creek Road\"). A postal address may include additional information such as postal codes or locality names without necessarily detailing the street (e.g., \"Garnet Valley, PA 19060\").\n\n3. **Street Address vs. Locality of Address**: A street address provides a complete physical location, including street and number (e.g., \"101/F, International Commerce Centre\"). Locality of address refers to broader geographic areas or neighborhoods without specific street details (e.g., \"Chinatown\" or \"West Kowloon\").", "currency": "**Tips to distinguish 'currency' label:**\n- Currency values are typically numerical representations of money, often formatted with two decimal places (e.g., 10.99, 27.50).\n- They are usually accompanied by a currency code (e.g., USD, GBP) that indicates the type of currency.\n- Look for values that represent prices or costs associated with products or services.\n\n**Tips to distinguish 'language' label:**\n- Language values are usually represented as short codes or full names that denote a specific language (e.g., English, Spanish).\n- They do not have a numerical format and are not associated with monetary values.\n- Language labels often appear in contexts related to communication or translation rather than pricing.", "Language": "**Tips to distinguish the 'language' label:**\n- Look for values that represent a specific language, such as \"English,\" \"Portugu\u00eas,\" or language codes like \"en.\" \n- The language value is typically a single word or a short abbreviation that clearly indicates the language of the content.\n\n**Tips to distinguish the 'price' label:**\n- Identify values that represent monetary amounts, often formatted with a currency symbol (e.g., \"$24.95,\" \"EUR 14.28\").\n- Price values usually include decimal points and may be accompanied by additional information about the currency type, indicating they are financial figures rather than language descriptors.", "Brand": "**Tips to distinguish the 'brand' label:**\n\n1. **Brand vs. Description of Product**: The 'brand' label typically refers to the name of the company or manufacturer that produces the item. In contrast, the description of the product provides details about the item itself, such as its features, materials, or intended use. Look for phrases that describe the product's characteristics or functions to identify the description.\n\n2. **Brand vs. Weight**: The 'brand' label will always denote the name of the manufacturer, while the weight label will contain numerical values followed by units of measurement (e.g., grams, pounds). If the column contains a specific weight measurement, it should be classified as weight, not brand.\n\n3. **Brand vs. Category**: The 'brand' label identifies the manufacturer, while the category label classifies the product into a broader group or type (e.g., electronics, clothing). If the column contains terms that describe the type of product rather than the manufacturer, it should be categorized as category. Look for general terms that indicate the product's market segment.", "DayOfWeek": "**Tips to distinguish 'day of week' from 'distance':**\n\n1. **Content Type**: The 'day of week' label typically contains names of the days (e.g., Monday, Tuesday) or combinations of them (e.g., Friday; Saturday). In contrast, the 'distance' label usually consists of numerical values, often accompanied by units of measurement (e.g., miles, kilometers).\n\n2. **Format**: Days of the week are often presented in a textual format, while distances are numerical and may include decimal points (e.g., 5.2 miles).\n\n3. **Contextual Relevance**: If the context of the data relates to scheduling, availability, or operations, it is likely to be 'day of week'. If it pertains to location, travel, or measurements, it is likely to be 'distance'.\n\n4. **Separator Usage**: The 'day of week' label may use semicolons or commas to separate multiple days, while 'distance' values are typically standalone numbers without such separators. \n\nBy focusing on these distinguishing features, you can effectively differentiate between the 'day of week' and 'distance' labels.", "unitCode": "**Tips to distinguish 'unit code' from 'weight':**\n\n1. **Format and Structure**: The 'unit code' typically follows a specific alphanumeric format, often including letters and numbers (e.g., BSC-01-UNS-L). In contrast, 'weight' is usually represented as a numerical value followed by a unit of measurement (e.g., 5 oz, 200 g).\n\n2. **Contextual Relevance**: 'Unit code' is used to identify a specific product variant or SKU, while 'weight' provides information about the mass of the product. If the value describes a product's physical characteristics rather than its identification, it is likely 'weight'.\n\n3. **Data Type**: 'Unit code' values are often unique identifiers that do not change, while 'weight' values can vary based on the product size or packaging. If the values are consistent across similar products, they are likely 'unit codes'.\n\n4. **Associated Information**: Look for accompanying details; 'unit code' may be linked to inventory or product categorization, while 'weight' is often associated with shipping or handling information.
