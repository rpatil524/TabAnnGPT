For example, \"New 2021 Toyota Corolla LE FWD 4D Sedan\" is a 'name of product', while \"T21767\" is a 'product model'.", "BookFormatType": "To distinguish the 'book format' label from the 'number' label, focus on the type of information each column contains. \n\n- 'Book format' typically includes terms like \"Hardcover,\" \"Paperback,\" or \"E-book,\" which describe the physical or digital form of a book. These are qualitative descriptors related to the book's presentation.\n\n- In contrast, the 'number' label is associated with numerical data, such as page counts, publication years, or ISBN numbers. These are quantitative values that provide specific numerical information about the book.\n\nBy identifying whether the column contains descriptive terms about the book's format or numerical data, you can accurately distinguish between the 'book format' and 'number' labels.", "Photograph": "**Tips to distinguish 'photograph' from 'rating':**\n- 'Photograph' values typically contain URLs or file paths ending in image formats like .jpg, .png, etc., indicating a visual representation.\n- 'Rating' values are numerical, often representing scores or percentages, and do not contain any file extensions or URL structures.\n\n**Tips to distinguish 'photograph' from 'url':**\n- 'Photograph' values are URLs or file paths specifically pointing to image files, often ending in image file extensions like .jpg, .png, etc.\n- 'Url' values are general web addresses that may lead to various types of content, not limited to images, and often include domain names and paths without specific image file extensions.", "Movie/name": "Tips to distinguish 'name of movie' from 'duration':\n- 'Name of movie' typically consists of a title, often followed by a year in parentheses, e.g., \"Frozen (2013)\".\n- 'Duration' is usually a numeric value followed by a unit of time, such as \"93 Min.\" or \"102 Min.\".\n\nTips to distinguish 'name of movie' from 'name of person':\n- 'Name of movie' is generally a title, sometimes with a year in parentheses, e.g., \"The Terminator (1984)\".\n- 'Name of person' consists of a first and last name, and sometimes includes middle names or initials, e.g., \"Lewis Carroll\" or \"Jane Campion\".", "Country": "- **Tips to distinguish 'country' from 'rating':**\n  - 'Country' values typically consist of country names or their abbreviations (e.g., \"US\", \"France\", \"Germany\").\n  - 'Rating' values are usually numerical or star-based, often representing a score or evaluation (e.g., \"4.5\", \"PG\", \"R\").\n  - Look for context: 'Country' is often associated with geographical or location data, while 'rating' is linked to reviews or assessments.\n\n- **Tips to distinguish 'country' from 'currency':**\n  - 'Country' values are names or codes representing nations (e.g., \"UK\", \"KH\").\n  - 'Currency' values are symbols or codes representing monetary units (e.g., \"USD\", \"\u20ac\").\n  - Contextual clues: 'Country' is related to location or origin, whereas 'currency' is associated with financial transactions or pricing.", "OfferItemCondition": "- **Item Condition vs. Currency**: Item condition typically describes the state of a product, such as \"NewCondition\" or \"UsedCondition\". In contrast, currency values represent monetary amounts and are usually accompanied by currency symbols or codes like USD, EUR, or GBP. Look for numeric values with currency symbols to identify currency.\n\n- **Item Condition vs. Boolean**: Item condition describes the state of a product, such as \"NewCondition\". Boolean values are limited to true/false or yes/no states. If the value is a simple true/false, it's likely a boolean.\n\n- **Item Condition vs. Item Availability**: Item condition refers to the state of the product, like \"NewCondition\". Item availability indicates stock status, such as \"InStock\" or \"OutOfStock\". Look for terms related to stock levels to identify availability.\n\n- **Item Condition vs. Identifier**: Item condition describes the state of a product, like \"NewCondition\". Identifiers are unique codes or numbers used to identify a product, such as SKU or model numbers. Look for alphanumeric codes to identify identifiers.\n\n- **Item Condition vs. URL**: Item condition describes the state of a product, like \"NewCondition\". URLs are web addresses that start with \"http://\" or \"https://\". Look for web address patterns to identify URLs.", "Time": "Tips to distinguish 'time' from 'rating':\n- 'Time' values typically represent specific points or periods, such as dates or timestamps (e.g., \"2019-05-23\").\n- 'Rating' values are usually numerical scores or grades, often in decimal form, representing quality or preference (e.g., \"4.7\").\n- If you see a numerical value that seems to evaluate or score something, it's likely a 'rating', not 'time'.\n\nTips to distinguish 'time' from 'duration':\n- 'Time' values often indicate specific moments or dates (e.g., \"2020-01-06\").\n- 'Duration' values represent lengths of time, often formatted with units like hours, minutes, or seconds (e.g., \"PT1H30M\").\n- If the value includes a format indicating a span of time (e.g., \"PT\" followed by numbers), it's likely a 'duration', not 'time'.", "Restaurant/name": "To distinguish the 'name of restaurant' label from the 'street address' label:\n\n1. **Name of Restaurant**: Typically consists of a unique or branded name that often includes words like \"Bistro,\" \"Grill,\" \"Cafe,\" or a person's name. It is usually a single phrase or a few words that do not resemble a location or address.\n\n2. **Street Address**: Usually includes numbers, street names, and sometimes additional location details like suite numbers or building names. It often contains terms like \"Street,\" \"Avenue,\" \"Road,\" or abbreviations like \"St.,\" \"Ave.,\" etc.\n\n**Tip**: If the value includes numeric components followed by street-related terms, it is likely a street address. If it is a standalone name without numeric or street-related terms, it is likely the name of a restaurant.", "addressLocality": "**Tips to distinguish 'locality of address' from 'identifier':**\n\n- **Locality of Address:** Typically includes names of streets, cities, or neighborhoods. These are often recognizable as geographic locations or parts of an address.\n- **Identifier:** Usually consists of alphanumeric codes or product numbers. These are not related to geographic locations and often appear as unique codes or IDs.\n\n**Tips to distinguish 'locality of address' from 'price range':**\n\n- **Locality of Address:** Contains geographic information such as street names, city names, or neighborhood identifiers.\n- **Price Range:** Represents monetary values or ranges, often accompanied by currency symbols (e.g., $, $$, $$$) or numerical ranges indicating cost.

They are structured as web links and do not describe payment methods.\n\n**Tip**: Look for the presence of web link structures to identify 'url' labels, and for lists of financial terms or payment methods to identify 'payment accepted' labels.", "Distance": "- **Distance vs. Unit Text**: Distance values typically include a numerical value followed by a unit of measurement related to length, such as \"cm\" or \"inches\". Unit text, on the other hand, often represents a standalone unit of measurement without a preceding numerical value, such as \"lbs\" or \"kg\". To distinguish, look for numerical values directly associated with length units for 'distance'.\n\n- **Distance vs. Quantitative Value**: Distance values are specific to measurements of length or space, often expressed with units like \"cm\" or \"inches\". Quantitative values, however, can represent a wide range of numerical data, such as weight, price, or quantity, and may not always include a unit of length. To differentiate, focus on whether the numerical value is specifically measuring length or space for 'distance'."}
