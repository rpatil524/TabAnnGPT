It can be an independent entity or part of a larger university system, offering a range of academic programs and fostering a community for learning and personal development.", "Politician": "A 'Politician' is identified by their involvement in government or public office, often holding titles such as president, prime minister, senator, or member of parliament. Keywords that distinguish a 'Politician' include titles and roles directly associated with governance and political leadership. For example, \"President of the People's Republic of China,\" \"Chairman of the National People's Congress,\" and \"Premier of the State Council\" are indicative of politicians. Unlike the general label 'Person,' which can refer to any individual, 'Politician' specifically refers to individuals with official political roles.", "OfficeHolder": "An \"OfficeHolder\" is an individual who occupies a specific position of authority or responsibility within a governmental or organizational structure, typically in a public office. This label should be used for individuals who have been elected or appointed to roles such as presidents, prime ministers, or other governmental officials. \n\n**Distinguishing Features:**\n- Titles such as \"President,\" \"Prime Minister,\" \"Senator,\" \"Governor,\" etc.\n- Associated with governmental roles and responsibilities.\n- Not to be confused with actors or characters from TV shows or movies.\n\n**Examples:**\n- Alexander Mackenzie (Prime Minister)\n- Wilfrid Laurier (Prime Minister)\n- William Lyon Mackenzie King (Prime Minister)\n\n**Non-Examples:**\n- Mary McCormack (Actor)\n- Kristin Chenoweth (Actor)\n- Josiah \"Jed\" Bartlet (Fictional Character from TV show)", "Newspaper": "A 'Newspaper' is a printed or digital publication that provides news, information, and commentary on current events, typically issued on a regular basis such as daily or weekly.

The key distinguishing feature is the pairing of the individual's name with a fictional character's name. For example, in a table, if Column 1 lists \"Martin Sheen\" and Column 2 lists \"Josiah Bartlet,\" \"Martin Sheen\" is labeled as 'Actor.'

This label is distinguished by the presence of names of individuals who have held the highest executive office in the government. Keywords often include full names of U.S. Presidents, such as \"Herbert Hoover,\" \"Franklin D. Roosevelt,\" and \"Harry S.

Unlike the general labels 'Person' or 'Politician,' 'PrimeMinister' denotes a specific role and title.

Do not use this label for general politicians or other public figures.", "Writer": "A 'Writer' is an individual who is the author of written works, such as books, articles, or other literary compositions. The label 'Writer' should be used when referring to the person who created the work, not the title of the work itself.
