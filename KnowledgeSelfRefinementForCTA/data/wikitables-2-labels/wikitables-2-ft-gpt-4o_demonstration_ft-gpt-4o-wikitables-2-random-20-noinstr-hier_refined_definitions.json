It is distinguished from other labels by focusing on the nature of the award itself rather than the genre or type of the work.

Unlike \"music writer,\" which may refer to lyricists, a \"music composer\" focuses on the musical composition itself. For example, in a list of song credits, names like \"John Williams\" or \"Hans Zimmer\" would be labeled as \"music composer.\" Additionally, if multiple names are listed together in the context of creating music, they should be labeled as \"music composers.\" \n\nExamples:\n- Column 2: \"Maurice Ravel\" in \"New York City Ballet Ravel Festival\"\n- Column 3: \"Kanye West, Adam Levine, Michael Masser, Gerry Goffin\" in \"Heard 'Em Say\"", "broadcast.radio_station": "A \"radio station\" is identified by its call sign or frequency and is associated with broadcasting audio content via radio waves.
